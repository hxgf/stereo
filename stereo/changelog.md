# 1.3.0
## Jun 2019


Greetings, dear ones, I am pleased to bring you the latest version of our beloved internet toolkit. The focus for this release is twofold: 1) removing that which is no longer useful and 2) making it easier than ever to achieve nice results.

May this release bring you joy and prosperity as you continue with your daily work.

And so it is:

- moved source repo to GitLab! - https://gitlab.com/hxgf/stereo

- upgraded Tachyons version - 4.11.2
- upgraded jQuery version - 3.4.1 üòà
- cool generic default favicon (it's a white circle now)
- added favicons in various sizes for various platforms (in /images/favicons)
- .htaccess - rewrite url to serve primary favicon at /favicon.ico
- .htaccess - force SSL by default (if available)
- default responsive viewport: width=device-width, initial-scale=1
- updated breakpoints.css to match Tachyons media query breakpoints
- killed the boilerplate demo, moving to new examples section in docs
- app.css ‚úàÔ∏è styles.css
- /stereo/lib - new vendor folder for 3rd-party PHP libs (good place for stuff you want to add manually [not using composer], such as phmagick or simple_html_dom)
